Introduction:

This project explores a dataset consists of 15,000 records, each representing an individual's workout session. It contains
both physiological attributes and exercise-related parameters, making it ideal for calorie burn analysis. Using statistical
techniques, data visualization, and machine learning, I analyze how factors such as exercise duration, heart rate,
body temperature, weight, height, and age influence calorie expenditure.


The primary columns includes:

Features:
    1. User_Id      ---  Unique identifier for individuals.
    2. Gender       ---  Male or Female.
    3. Age          ---  Age of the individual.
    4. Height       ---  Height in centimeters.
    5. Weight       ---  Body weight in kilograms.
    6. Duration     ---  Duration(minutes) of the exercise session
    7. Heart_rate   ---  Heart rate(bpm) measured during exercise.
    8. Body_temp    ---  Body temperature(celsius) during physical activity

Target:
    Calories        ---  Total calories burned(kcal).


Our goal is to explore the data and build a predictive model to estimate the calories burnt. To improve predictive
performance, I also apply feature engineering, creating new variables by combining existing ones. The goal is to
develop an accurate calorie prediction model, which helps estimate calorie expenditure based on an individual's
physiological characteristics and exercise data.
